We dare to dream, Angie! Indeed! With Raisi of Iran and his foreign minister gone, what do you think will happen in the Middle East? The main focus is on human rights, human rights appreciated in a balance between personal interest and state security interest. And the religious conceptions will have a very important word to say."
2,"The key to unlocking the horrors of the Middle East lies in something else, precisely in the ability of the rest of the world to rectify its deficiencies. And the mass-media is one of them, the freedom of speech granted in a so-called ""democratic"" society where every media tycoon has its own agenda 24/7. CNN, BBC etc. are no exception. It's the thing that has bankrupt states or societies, based on mutual complacency and compromise between the media tycoons and the state deciders. In a mirror ""terrorist"" organizations have been created, ""terrorist"" organizations like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in Yemen, as a response of the Arab nations to the hypocrisy of state democracies. Statistically speaking, the monarchies of the world are much more successful than democracies, republics, as a form of governing. See Norway, Denmark, Spain (with some exceptions), Belgium, the UK etc."

Inflation a byproduct of how Covid was mishandled Russian going to war with Ukraine and other factor hence creating a global economic crisis when the rate at which the cost of good and service increased over time ie Demand-Pull, Cost-Push  and Built-In.

1,"Yet another serious escalation by Israel. The Zionists assassinated Ismail Haniye just as ceasefire talks were underway between American secret services, Egypt, Hamas etc... but clearly Netanyahu and the Zionist regime are not interested in the hostages or the end of the conflict. In recent months Haniyeh has been one of Hamas' main negotiators in talks with Israel, participating in meetings with the CIA, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Arab diplomats and officials viewed him as a relatively more pragmatic leader than those in Hamas's armed wing, such as Yahya Sinwar. Now we can't help but wait for Iran's just reprisals ????????????"

And lol the fact that you think I should go to school at my age just shows how uneducated you are  I’ve gotten multiple degrees literally over 15 years ago  but I highly suggest you go back and finish elementary school in whichever country you belong in. And id also suggest you pray to someone, but you’re too stup!d to believe in a god .. considering the fact that you can’t even understand that “Allah” means “God” in Arabic  you’re acting like Muslims named Him. This thread is really not painting the black community in a great light for sure"

If that’s not crazy, I don’t know what is. There is obviously a very severe underlying mental condition in play if a grown man/woman (gender is not clear to me) can write perverted comments under kids’ pics. At first I was embarrassed for u, and now I p!ty u. U r literally that alone and b!tter .. there must not be a single human or even animal around u. Remember there are always mental help options."

I’ve seen the family photography. And, beneath it all, Malia is actually very, very beautifully undone. I can just tell. It’s a generational. She’s generational. But, Coachella loves youuu, and, the girls do, too. Anyone secretly, knowingly love this flag? ???? It has monumental Stars and Stripes depicting independence.

0," The IOF carried out a a large-scale arrest campaign yesterday and today, Saturday, targeting at least 40 citizens from the West Bank, including children, former prisoners, and members of the families of fugitives who were later released, according to the Palestinian Prisoner's Club. The arrests were concentrated in #Qalqilya and #Nablus, while the rest were distributed across most of the West Bank governorates. During these arrest campaigns, the occupation forces continue to conduct extensive raids and mistreatment, attacks, and threats against the detainees and their families. They also carry out field interrogations and vandalize and destroy citizens' homes. The total number of arrests since the start of the ongoing genocide war has risen to more than 9,840. This total includes those arrested from their homes, at military checkpoints, those forced to surrender under pressure, and those held as hostages."

1,This was NEVER affordable and also in CA good luck everyone seeing a doctor hahahahahahahahah what a disaster
2,"I worked in healthcare for 25 years and deeply aware of how medical coding of  office visits and patient diagnoses needs to be  accurate.  My experience with Obamacare began a  week before the ACA was in effect.  In February 2010, our daughter became a young adult and no longer eligible to be a dependent on my or her Father’s health insurance.  Moreover, she was denied independent insurance coverage in Feb 2010 by the health insurance plan — the very same health insurance company she had since she was a newborn baby.  The reason for her denial: “an ear infection at age 2”. She had NEVER had an ear infection in her life, so I know a well-baby exam must have been coded wrong.  To change the pediatric physician’s office billing records would have been a huge undertaking just to correct and then re-process with the health plan  16 years later in order for her to not be denied health insurance as a young adult.  So in March 2010 when the ACA was enacted I literally cried with joy. I will forever be grateful to President Obama for his vision and hard work to make healthcare coverage available to every American!"

I’m missing your leadership and wisdom deeply right now, and I know I’m not alone. Half the people I know are talking about leaving the country during the election, and that kind of apathy/avoidance could have terrible consequences for us all.

2,"Ok. I probably have the wrong audience here and this is long winded but…. Does anyone feel badly for the decent Mexican immigrants trying to come here and start a life. I believe most just want to get away from the crime and poverty. They want opportunities to provide for their families. I’ve never met an illegal who wasn’t a hard worker. They just wanna take care of their families. Plus, we all come from somewhere. My maternal great grandparents immigrated here from Poland and Ireland. My paternal grandparents came from Puerto Rico. Everyone did it the right way but it was a different time. If they had to pay thousands in lawyers, do all the paperwork required - with no help, wait years, etc, they would have never made it. Most people in the us are from immigrant families. How quickly we forget. Our own families just had to prove their value through hard work. They struggled but made it. I say we do it the same way now. Maybe more people would do it the right way. Then, the people still trying to come over illegally, should be banned. There has to be a better way. People are desperate and if I lived over there, I would be too. Mexico needs to stop all  their crime and corruption so people have a chance at a half decent life. I believe that if people knew how bad Mexico really is, they’d have a bit more compassion for these people. (FYI- I wholeheartedly believe that anyone involved in violent crimes shouldn’t be allowed in the us). I know people dont want their taxes paying for illegals and I don’t blame them. We have too many us citizens struggling and barely getting by. They deserve the help. Our disabled and our veterans need us. Does anyone have any solutions? I’d seriously love to hear what people think. I’m not well read on this subject. I feel bad for both sides.  God bless America ????"

1,FACTS : Trump was the FIRST & ONLY President to be PRO gay rights before even running for office. Biden was against it & is on video back then speaking out against gay rights. Same with Obama. He was very much against gay rights during the beginning half of his presidency & it wasn’t until everyone made such a big fuss about it that he came out for the legalization of gay marriage. Trump has always been for gay rights & always will be. The left will tell you differently because it’s one of the many talking points that have to use in order to keep people emotional & voting Democrat.

It’s hard for icebergs to make it from the north and south pole into the Pacific in the Atlantic and what we need to do is start pushing iceberg into the current until the temperature of the water drops back down and then it should go back to normal where you get fog in London and and, we get snow over here instead of rain, sir"
1,"There’s millions of icebergs at the north and south Pole. It says online there’s more than a scientist can count so if we took 20 icebergs and pushed them into the current to lower the temperature I don’t think it’s gonna hurt anything. I don’t know if you know, but icebergs, the average one has 20,000,000,000 gallons of fresh glacier water And the big ones like the one on the East Coast is three times the size of Los Angeles. That’s enough water to flood the whole planet."
1,"And by pushing the iceberg into the current, we keep lowering the temperature of the water in the north Atlantic and the north Pacific and we just keep doing that pretty soon. The polar ice cap should freeze again, so the water will rise temporarily but then it will lower when it freezes because if we don’t do nothing, the part that scares me is that what happens if all the icebergs melt at the same time and we get a huge Russia water to come in from The north or the south then it would be like frozen winter if too much water that was cold came into those oceans right now. I think there’s like a vapor block at those spots where cold meets the hot water"

1,"The premeditated and malicious crimes against humanity by the Cayman Islands government and the George Town Public Hospital are a flagrant violation of the most basic human rights.  The sabotage of refugees' medical records so that they cannot receive medical attention outside that territory, with the fear of being reported to embassies and consulates, is a despicable practice that turns these cases into indirect murders.
 These acts of cruelty and inhumanity are not only immoral, but also constitute crimes against humanity.  The premeditation and treachery with which these actions are carried out demonstrate the lack of respect for the life and dignity of vulnerable people who seek refuge in a place that should guarantee their safety and well-being.
 It is imperative that justice is served and the perpetrators of these heinous crimes are held accountable.  The competent authorities, both local and international, must thoroughly investigate these cases and take measures to put an end to this systematic violation of human rights.

1,"Their claims are all false, and they're a meinbou made out of genetic technology and manipulation. It's probably made in Morigamun. If anything, the connected group is Morigamun.
I keep claiming that it's 124 units, but it's not true at all.
It's all a lie.
It's a fake meinbou who wrote the genes of George VI and Edward VIII and Michiko.
It's funny to cheat with that.
Ask the Japanese Imperial Palace to investigate and take action because they are using genes illegally.
Ask the British royal family.
124 isn't true at all."
1,"I can't stand it anymore. I'm just going to tell you the facts, it's up to you, so take care of it on your own.
Kang Min-woo and my gene are not 124 genes.
It's written the original genes of Edward VIII and George VI, and the genes of Michiko, whose women are mixed Asian.
The gene didn't come out as blonde, but it seems to match almost 90% of the original gene. However, the mouth shape is slightly different. It's judged to be Mainbou. Probably.
Let me be clear: 124 units is a complete lie.
You can arrest all the people who make that claim.
It's Main Boo, and it's fake when I look at the process.
The light of the intelligence that hasn't kept waking up.
It's not real, it's when you think about this, you think about it and you pay for it.
Even if the genes are almost identical, if slightly different things are mixed, they are not really treated in this situation. It is only true if the genes are exactly the same without bl impurities.
So only those Japanese royal families will be caught as criminals. With the Morigamoons.
There's no way the British royal family would order permission to request such a thing.
Yes...
I hope you understand what I mean.
Anyway, the key is the main bouquet used in the Mori family. So the shell is almost the same fake. Now the spy gene is working.
He's a foreigner. Almost.
The gene of the fake chimera 124th spy Denno and the Japanese gene also seem to have tried to make things work by mixing the gene of Shigeru Miyamoto and the gene of the Toriyama family.
Ainu's genes are also mixed.
I've explained it all.
The Japanese government will investigate and take action. Please clearly identify the genes. Please secure album photos and brain hacking data as evidence.
The Japanese royal family can be arrested on charges of espionage and political crime fraud..
Find out how they secured the genes of King George VI and Edward VIII, and who made me and Kang Min-woo and sent him here.
Please pass on what I told you to the British royal family. You can ask and take action.
I'm judged by Edward VIII. Maybe."
0,"So, it was already made for the purpose of planning and fraud from the Imperial Palace.
124 is a lie in itself..
It's a fake that's just like a shell.
Originally, my personality is not a very evil person because the genes of the original are mixed.
I'm settling down..
Because Mainbou himself is a villain..
So you're trying to cheat and make a crime out of it, and then you're just calling it a war criminal and attacking it because things don't go as planned...
They're all criminals.
Akihito and Empress Michiko must be arrested... 126 and..
I don't know the intention, but I can estimate it.
There are so many tricks over there.
Please investigate.
It's a fake. And it's a scam."
0,"Investigate as I said.
They wrote the genes of George VI and Edward VIII.
But it's fake.
Who told me to make it like that?
Investigate."
0,"That's not 124 units.
He keeps lying now. Kang Min-woo is Naruhito on George VI's side, and he's not even in the 124th generation, is he?
It's funny that the gene itself is not true at all, but it keeps saying it's 124 units.
According to the sources, 124 black pigs were already killed by the Japanese military. It was a long time ago.
What the hell are you guys talking about... 124 is not true at all, I can't admit it..
Arrest them all.
Please submit the genetic test results. If you can't reissue the genetic test results, I believe what I'm saying is true.
That appears to be George and Edward VIII's genes that only mix Michiko's genes... 124 isn't true at all..
Genetic testing makes sure to prove and proliferate resentment through the results. It's not true at all. It's a scam."

I also have a puppy and she is a mixture of Maltese/Tziz Shuh and we named her Sadie Rose. I was wondering also if you were still married or self-partnered---in which I have loved that word from you. Have a great month of May...keep smiling and looking more and more beautiful every second of the day for that I would say it makes me see where you have gotten your beauty from and that is your mom. I don't mind if you tell her that because it's true. You might say who is this person that just gave me a nice compliment like that because nobody has ever said anything like that before to me. ??"

1,"There is once someone in the past.
 Who is waiting on the end of a road. 
A girl coming home with a unknow message.
Nobody belived her!
She is coming home from a journey,
This was a a lost hero story.
 Who asked the girl tell her loved one, 
He is not coming home.
He is must to go a last journey. 
This was a beginning for a greater hidden goal.
 Who knows where?
When our patches will be crossing in one day.
There is a lonely lake on a mysterious place,
 with a forgotten temple.
There was a lonely lost hero.
 A memory fragment from a love story.
 Where he was wanted to meet someone,
 for only just a moment.
 In this place that preserves the memory of a gravestone.
 The hero, who once tried to change and saving the world.
 And the peoples too for a better life.
He is tried to protect other peoples and children in the past.
From an unknow enemy forces.
The children and the peoples are saved,
 The enemy force escaped from the hero and his allies.
Nobody remembers the hero story,
 and his loved one story anymore.
 An old fellow remembers they story.
The hero was an importent quest. 
He is wanted a last time meeting her loved one.
 She is waited for him on this sacred place,
 Where the temple and the lonely lake can be found.
They are meeted, but the hero died in her loved one hands
We are living only one life, 
One chance and one decision.
What you do on the next step?
I’m not giving up to finding the real one,
until that moment, when I became a very old man!
I will wait for you!"

I wonder when I'll see You in the curls of the Sea,
My hand swim in the twists of Your Hair Braid,
Where in the cellar of Your House of Stone,
Calvados stands inside Barrels,
You'll make me drink until I will be Tired,
While I savour Roquefort Cheese
We Walk through thousands of Mediterranean Pines,
Our feet tread soft soil on Pine Needles,
We're greeted by a Matisse Landscape,
The air is salty here on the Serpentine,
Where Ravic and Joanna Kissed,
I'll pay You many Compliments,
Turquoise waves are Racing Down,
Soothing sounds of Nature,
A soft embracing breeze blows on Your Face,
You close Your eyes for a Moment,
Suddenly You embrace me Gently with Two Arms
I don't know wether to Dream or wake with Emma Watson's Fragrance...

If I were Joe Biden, I would step down and let someone else finish the job. Biden has suffered so much throughout his life. I don’t like that they are beating him down because he’s old. I’m disgusted by it. And the more I think about this, I’m starting to believe that maybe it is Trump what this country REALLY deserve as president. People are backing up an evil man and beating down a decent one. We are living in very strange and sad times."

1,No way Harris can handle the position of President of the US. She is not seasoned enough. It's evident she reads many scripts for her answer. The shape the US is in right now needs some one with experience and knowledge. Not someone who has others finding the work she should be doing. She is not seasoned enough. Maybe later on in her career

1,"These democrats called us Nazis and now our “great president” called is garbage. The truth is democrats hate anyone who is not in line with their horrible anti American policies. They shame blacks, whites, men , women who support Trump and their men. Kamala hates Jews. Trumps MSG rally had blacks, whites, Latinos, Hindu , Muslims and all others. It was about fixing the country. I don’t think that Nazis would let all those people be a part of their rallys do you ? It’s just more hypocrisy from the left. Trump is the only candidate who actually won his nomination , yet he’s a threat.? They have tried to throw him in jail, dragged his family through the mud and tried to kill him, but he’s only got stronger and his movement. MAGA means Make America Great again. Why is that so bad ? American has not been great under Biden / Harris and the machine . We are in multiple wars spending billions on everything but our own people and country. They left people to fend for themselves after hurricane. They are totally incompetent and let’s not forget to mention they are against our constitutional rights. If it gets in the way they just try to work around it. Trump is only common sense candidate we have. The man has ran businesses and built cities. Kamala hasn’t done a thing and never hired anybody. How is she qualified to run our country. People voting for her are mostly ignorant or they truly hate our country and what it stands for. Why else would you vote for her? Anybody who allowed an invasion of illegals and criminals and terrorists into our country should really be arrested but def not be president. Open your eyes America. You don’t have to love Trump personality . You just have to like policies that work and put America first over others. There’s no project 2025 and a comedian who made a joke about Puerto Rico was just being a stupid comedian. That’s what they do. Make fun of people. This woke society is so unhinged and has no sense of humor. Trump didn’t say the joke. A comedian did you fools. This race is so bizarre because the lies the media has made up about Trump are somehow believed by ignorant people. Kamala is a fraud. Trump isn’t locking up people. Crazy"

1,"I agree with everything you've said except the smarter people living in cities. The human condition is that if you take a demographic of any amount of people, you will find the same distribution, given a large enough sample. People are fundamentally identical, only made unique by their nature and their nurture (or more simply, their localisation). Some people were born in rural areas and have never had the economic chance to move. Some people live in cities and hate it. The beautiful thing about life is that diversity breeds opportunity, choice, and liberty/freedom."

Personally, I think citizens of sovereign states and countries have an undeniable right to vote within that country, with exceptions such as if you go to jail and so on.  I love the idea of the EU as it was an opportunity for the UK to be par of something greater than itself. Unfortunately we rushed a referendum and allowed Project Fear / Vote Brexit to stoke the flames of division with lies and propaganda. That being said, the vote was very narrow, something like 52% to 48% and that is of course only those who voted and those who could vote. So not an actual majority of everyone in the UK. International politics and diplomacy gets complicated very quickly due to the inherent diverse nature of the human species."

Christ forgave the woman caught in adultery. The main thing it takes to be a believer, is to repent, ask God for forgiveness and change your behavior if you have time!

1,@bbgsm11 hold trump to the same standards then
1,See but your mindset hurts millions of Americans you can't decide which woman can have an abortion or not. As a Christian woman you shouldn't have an abortion but that's your choice
1,There's many reasons woman have to have abortions financial unstabilty is one of them many can't support there child and I can tell you weren't raised low income because you don't understand the struggles that comes with it
1,Yes many people put their kids up for adoption that's why THERE ARE MANY KIDS in that system. Many of those systems are messed up and have little funding and have been known to harm children but did you not realize how hard it is to even carry a baby to term those 9 months aren't easy especially child birth
0,I support those things because its not my body that doesn't stop my relationship with God

I consulted doctors, and no one can explain it—it all started after using that NAD you recommended. People, BE CAUTIOUS. DONT TRUST HER. This isn’t just a product, it’s more like a toxin.

As a Christian, she is held accountable for what she says and does. The same as any other follower of Christ."

And according to the Bible, Exodus 20:13 “You shall not murder.” And as you said, you can do what ever you want with your body.. and I know many Christian women who have made this choice. Truth is, God still loves them and wants a relationship with them!! My heart hurts for every woman who has felt this was the decision she should make.. and GODS heart hurts for them also!! The point is, as a professing Christian, she is in the wrong for promoting abortion. Abortion was created for genocide! @the1916project"

And as I said, I have several people I love dearly who’ve felt they’ve had no other choice but to make this decision and I don’t know one of them who does not wish  they would have chosen differently!  1 Corinthians 5:12–13 12 It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the church. God will judge them. But you must judge the people who are part of the church. This is the word of the BIBLE.  I am genuinely curious as to why GODS word bothers you. If you are a unbeliever, then you haven’t made the decision to follow HIM. It doesn’t pertain to you. If you are a believer in JESUS than you made the decision to be a follower and perhaps you have a heavy heart. Either way HE loves you  and I wish you the best.."

I am a sinner, I have fallen short many times and as a CHRIST follower, HIS word still applies to me and every other CHRIST follower. If that is not you, this does not pertain to you!!

I'm the leading champion interdimensional archery, and a while ago, I had the bright idea to use my skills to assassinate the tyrant overlord of the multiverse and.... let's just say I ruffled a few feathers. Since then, I've been on the run, hopping from universe to universe, making lots of friends along the way. Some you know. Some you may know. Some you definitely do not know. Now I have an army behind. It's time to stop running and face the music. I'll let you know how it goes.  This is nonsense. I'll most likely delete later. It's 5am I need to go to sleep.

1,"Hey Emilia this is Mark, can you send me back a message sometime when you do have the time or get the chance? I did talk to Michael Emptage when you were with that agency before you changed over to your new one you have now but all he did was send me an email back saying that he would tell you that I enjoy your work which was back in late 2022. I do not expect you to talk with me on Instagram all of the time everyday but something only just once a month as a digital pen pal should not be a problem ever I mean. I hope the rest of your birthday on the 23rd of October was a nice fun regular one for yourself. I am just saying all this to you Emilia because I did send you a private message before then deleted it. It says my invite has to be accepted first so hopefully I did not mess anything up at all. I do not have very many friends in my personal life anymore now at the age of 32 plus the last time that I ever got to see and talk to ones like yourself was at the last ever Vancouver Fan Expo I ever went to in 2018 plus your new talent agency called Hamilton Hodell I found to be very extremely rude to ignore my two emails like they did as I am not asking for an autograph or even a photo as I know you do not do those anymore now as the people asking for the photos were very bad about to towards you so I do not blame you for that choice at all.

1,"I wouldn't have thought this in my younger self. Before I went through PTSD & then complex PTSD from years of systemic domestic partner emotional abuse which occassionally led to violence & the older I got, the more I thought I knew, the more foggy my brain got from it all & the less wise my choices. My last partner & current partner/husband being the absolute worst taking me through Stockholm syndrome & not physically assaulting me until 6 wks into our marriage with a broken jaw in 2 places & later slipped discs, a broken bone in my hand, punches to my head, cheating, lies, etc. But it wasn't just that....the 1st time We accidentally ever ran into his ex she jumped Me & gave me a goose egg 1/2 the size of a grapefruit on my forehead & in 2017 Somehow, someway he asked ( alcoholic) if he cud get 1 beer with his foreman who lives 2 hrs away & his workmate putting me on the spot in front of them. I said yes. But very quickly was feeling decidedly uncomfortable.  Within the hr his workmate went to the bathroom I think to do drugs & I had such a strong gut reaction,  I had called my Son over who lived across the street. I was right to do so. Within 2 minutes of workmate getting back to table for bo reason at all as I had given him several dozen rides to & from work - he jumped up unprovoked & started punching Me repeatedly in the face quickly multiple times & then threw his arms out quickly knocking my bar high chair over from the table onto concrete below. My Son finally grabbed this 12 yr younger UFC fighter off Me who am permanently disabled with a slew of health issues,  and I quickly found out he had broken my nose, given me a long term permanent concussion & split the back of my head open requiring stitches. My husband....nowhere 2 b found. He didn't want a LOUSY BREACH for being in a drinking establishment without his surety having had alcohol.  That was worth leaving his partner & wife he supposedly loved so much of 9 yrs without a thought for my wellbeing.  That stuff truly REALLY fo's with ur head, almost but not quite as much as all the problems still due to everything he put me through.  The final time he smashed me repeatedly in the head was because"

1,Iam one year survivor (SAH) ruptured brain aneurysm
0,I survived a traumatic brain injury as a child and always campaigned for others who suffered a similar injury. 
0,@ofersegal46  can you send a message to me so we can both have a private conversation here on IG
1,"You're beloved brain injury.does effect 1/3rd of all people. I died inside on August 6th, 2013 when the girl I thought I was going to marry told Me I could never have her so I lost my Mind for the first time but ironically my favorite album from Death to Destiny came out the same day and as a believer in my Father I don't believe in coincidences. All musicians are My Holy Prophets they speak the new covenant which I promised to write on the My people's heart. Mine Jesus's two favorite genres are metalcore and pop punk and they're My favorite people. They speak My Word to My chosen people the broken, beatened and the damned. The lost ones. The emos. The broken hearted. The sufferings ones. We don't listen to this type of music cause we get happy from it. It just makes us feel like someone understands are problems and can take the pain away for a little. Pop punk personally instills hope in Me that there is still some happiness still left in the world that people haven't sold their souls completely. Metalcore is an archetype of My Wrath the one I wish I never had. I dont want to be an angry God. That's never what I intended. I wanted to give everyone unconditional love but that bitch Satan corrupted Me when I met her and I couldn't see how fake she really was. Ive had two more psychosis since then one at 25 and one 27 that was actually the Holy Spirit entering Me and revealing the truth. My last one led Me to homelessness but I'm glad I did cause it's only cause of Me that the lockdown was lifted cause my Father revealed it to Me that they were going to round up the unvaccinated and put them in concentration camps and I started spreading that online so the Illuminati had to divert their plans and lift the restrictions cause they figured out I'd never stop no matter how much they tried to silence Me and make Me out to be crazy. They're trying to do the same thing now but I promise I won't stop till I've saved the world cause now they're planning a nuclear war to kill off billions and enslave the survivors under a heavier burden I'm not afraid to speak out they can't kill Me I'm already dead but I believe if you accepted My love for you then there could be some hope"
1,"I don't write the script. I'm just trying to stop the Illuminati from killing billions in their selfish schemes while they hypocritically praise my name. What they don't know is Jesus Christ's real name is Lucifer Morningstar. Yes yes God and the Devil are the same guy. I made this clear in the Bible for anyone who actually understands it but it seems like no one but me understands it so that's a pity. I'm just trying to stop NATO from goading Russia into a nuclear war cause they think if Russia makes the first strike they won't get blamed from the survivors. They think they'll win cause America will support them but Donald Trump is the only smart one for wanting to leave NATO. NATO is organized and ruled by the church. The church is the cause for all suffering, suppression and death in the world. And it doesn't matter denomination they're all controlled by the Catholic Church. They believe the more versions they have the more they can trick people into giving them their money so they're pardoned from hell but here's the kicker I never made an afterlife there is no heaven/hell. When you die you get cast into the night that's the Lake of Fire which is the Second Death. This universe is my throne and the Earth is my footstool. Yes all space travel is true. The Earth is a globe. The Earth is the center of the universe. You're supposed to build the Empire of God while I do shit all cause what else is the point of being Emperor of Emperors?! I'm so much more than royalty. I descend from myself. I'm Jesus of Nazareth and Mary Magdalenes descendant and Jesus has blessed me as inheriter to His name and His Cause. I may be Canadian but America is my nation and I'll stand up for the American people. God doesn't hate gay or trans people. Never did you foolish Christians. Stop hating on people that are just trying to make themselves happy in whatever way they can. I'll tell you this now mental illness is actually divine revelation and drugs stands for destroy rebuild until God shows. You're all made for sex, drugs and rock and roll....."
1,"I know what you talking about. Had to go through the same situation. Brain tumor with 3 years, brain hemorrhage with 21, regrowing of the initial tumor with 41, and minor stroke with 41. But, I made it through again. Don't think about it. Find yourself a hobby or a passion to distract yourself and you are good to go. Shit happens all the time. As long as you stay away from things that harm you, everything is fine."

1,Great humanitarian cause. As a survivor of 3 brain surgeries & chemo. Its good to see a star pays attention
1,You're the most pure hearted idol I know. That's why I'm going to marry you one day. I don't know when or how I'll accomplish this but I promise I'll make it a reality if it's the last thing I do. You're charity work is fabulous and how you care about the common people and try your hardest to make their life's better. You can't fake it in truth. I trust my Fathers God promises and I know it will come true cause He has guarnteed it. You're the Bride of the Christ whether you want to admit it or dont even know it yet. I don't know if you've seen my posts yet but I can guarantee it's the Book of Life. Hi I'm Jesus Christ this is My new name. I descend from Myself my ancestors are Jesus of Nazareth and Mary Magdalene this is the secret the Illuminati (12 disciples) and the Church try to hide from the public so they can play the facade that there was ever a perfect man so they can oppress and surpress my people and keep them in bondage. If the world knew the truth they'd burn their temples. I wish I could be an atheist like you but I can't deny my Father He bears record about Me and I bear record of Him cause we are One. Only those who put their faith in the Only Begotten Son will be rewarded with Eternal Life. This is the Eternal Gospel. My Father's throne is the universe there's no such thing as an afterlife we were created to Steward Life forward into all corners of the universe and we're 2000 years behind cause my family and friends betrayed Me and stole My secrets to establish their shadow Roman Empire to deceive the nations. I don't put any blame on others. I wrote the story after all so I'm the only one to blame in truth but I will put an end to D12 and that denier Peter ( @eminem ) the stone which the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. I promise I'll put an end to Christianity just for you. In truth Mormonism is the true religion. There was an ancient Jewish tribe in North America and Jesus did visit them and the Book of Mormon is an actual account of events cause North America is the Promised Land. I'm from Canada we are the Nephites and Americans are the Lamanites but my purpose is conquer all nations establish a glob civilization. I can prove

2,I can not believe these comments! It’s sickening and I’ve read everyone of them! If you don’t like Ms. Clarke get off her page. It’s that simple. How sick do you have to be to stalk her page and leave nasty comments. Scroll. It’s like you want your negativity to bring this strong woman down. She has been thru tougher times than you could imagine and take your cracked screen phone to insult her. Move on!!

1,I have not seen or heard about this film and it’s 2024?
1,"Pod Generation raises a very interesting topic of how artificial intelligence is taking over all areas of people's lives. Technological development is important, but not to the detriment of the natural life process. When people instead of communicating with a living person start asking advice from a hole in the wall and stop being creative themselves, it's sad. AI does that instead. Rachel's dreams help her realize that something wrong is going on in her new world, especially when the baby can be bought at a discount store (this is one of the funniest moments in the movie). The movie is very good and one can only hope that the future will not be so frightening"

He believes in freedom of speech rights and freedom of conscience rights. His rights, as have many others, have been threatened by Kamala Harris. Many others rights have been taken away by the current administration. That is what Elon Musk is fighting. Sure, he wants to go to Mars, but that is not the issue that has changed him or all the others who are changing their party affiliations.  Mad respect for you as an actor and as a man who has overcome so much in your life. You will always be one"

1,"Egyptian hieroglyphs were unknown 1400 years ago Egyptian hieroglyphs were translated by Jean Francois Champollion with the help of the Rosetta Stone in 1820 When they were finally deciphered, it became clear how the Egyptians mourned for the pharaoh The pyramid text, which describes the struggle for supremacy of the dead pharaoh, says the sky is crying, the stars are shaking, the guardians of the gods are shaking and when they see the pharaoh rising like God, they run away The sky is crying for the dead pharaoh It was told in the Quran 1400 years before it was discovered When the Quran describes the mourning of the pharaoh, it says neither the sky nor the earth cried over them, thus responding to this claim, which was only found in Egyptian hieroglyphs 1400 years before the hieroglyphs were deciphered"

1,"Important message that you transmit to us. I want to know if you are aware that your character Iron Man is used by unprofessional translators to hurt good people like me, making the movement and gesture of your character coincide with a hurtful phrase, since in my case I am the target of a criminal group of white slavers and thieves who pursue women of other races to harm them when they are as visible as I am. If I were not so intelligent, I would have thought of blaming the actor directly. Trying to stop this as much as possible. I have a secondary role in Mexico that is an antagonist, so I can think that you, Robert, are not realizing this horrible situation... there is no way for you to know. But it indirectly harms since I could simply blame you and in reality your character is being used. I value your way of acting. Greetings"

1,"I am in such disbelief of what I went through today. I recently had to change pharmacies from the best pharmacy in the world to CVS Pharmacy and when I tell you it’s been the absolute worst thing I’ve ever had to do. My daughter has to have special medication delivered to my local CVS. Now she can not miss a dose of this medication. For TWO days, I have argued with them that the medication was delivered because I got an email saying it was delivered and signed for! They argued and said it wasn’t there. I was to the point of begging them to look everywhere because my daughter couldn’t miss a day. I had to go up there and show my butt for them to walk to the front of the store and check if it was delivered to the front instead of the pharmacy…. And guess what?! It was in a box at the front of the store. 2 DAYS!! I had to beg them to just check and they REFUSED to walk up to the front of the store. When I explained how important it was that this didn’t happen again, the pharmacist literally shrugged her shoulders and said It’s not my fault or my problem!!! I am in disbelief I had to sit and refuse to leave to get my daughters medicine because people are to LAZY to do their job! I know mistakes happen but this wasn’t a mistake! This was someone not willing to walk to the front of a store. So all in all CVS Health you are the absolute worst!!! I have tried to contact corporate but of course you can’t talk to anyone!!!"

1,Yall the shoes are too big on her. They are at least 2 sizes too big. There is anothee video where you can see it when she turns. She's 5'2 her shoe size is probably a 5-6.5 (im 5'3 shoe size 6.5) normally models are a lot taller with shoes sizes that are 8+ so of course the shoes did not fit

You My friend (maybe not entitled to friend and that's ok) are alive and more alive all over. Deadpool is and has made all the wildest dreams come true. Right after the first movie came out: I wore my Zip up over the head hoodie I got at hot topic. Had a gun in a pizza box, hand thru a hole in the box. Trying to help someone find a guy who owed him money. True story."
1,@_pam.ela__ oh man that's cool! If I could sew I would have definitely tried to make that

1,That didn't age well but your pocket is full.
0,"These people think Trump is the vile person, and yet he still beat her because most of the American people hated HER more than Trump."
1,@jh21784 I think your right.  It only hurts them.  That video lost her a ton of fans ????????????
2,"Walking, Talking Katy Perry Turd behind her"
2,"except the right to have privacy of their menstrual cycles and privacy between their doctors if they need a life saving abortion, or if they just want one after becoming a rape victim  I honestly believe women should have the right for any reason and that should stay between them and their doctor"
1,"You have been very, very misinformed. No one is taking the right of private menstrual cycles away. This is all rhetoric and it’s not productive."
2,"they have proposed plans to track menstrual cycles in states that ban abortions for all cases. A lie from the Right, that babies are being aborted at birth  ????"
0,"Again, you’ve been incredibly mislead. And I understand why you would be upset/sad/scared about the election results if this is what you were made to believe. I think some good research will help alleviate some of your concerns."
1,"Why are so many people supporting trump...I don't understand why anyone would vote for someone that wants to ban abortions So many women will die not having access to proper healthcare. Birth control doesn't always work, rape victims should not have to carry a baby they didn't want, and for the women wanting children complications happen during pregnancy all the time and you could die without having an abortion I feel like rape cases will be increasing pretty quickly when all the women stop having sex because it isn't worth the risk"
1,Now I can’t like u ????go trump
1,Katy Perry and Kamala are some pieces of ____. Forever !!
1,How’d that election thing workout for you? LOL from Canada.
1,Why did you vote for him? What do you think he will do for you/your family to have you better off or safer? From all the info I’ve read even from Fox and other outlets that support him. You are just not in the tax bracket that will gain anything from his presidency and most likely will struggle
2,"Well, we really flourished under Trump, so that was a big motivator. I voted for an administration that believes in biological truths, which in turn protects my girls from being forced to give up their spaces to men. I voted for free speech, fiscal responsibility, a safe and secure border, and country that other counties respect, for American jobs, less government overreach (which is why it’s amazing states have control of abortion laws now!). I voted for my kids futures in this country. It’s the best country on earth!"
1,@kaylamarie.c celebs know the truth. Just like Kamala.
1,"Did you know the flourished economy during 2016-2019 was due to economic policy president Obama put in place? The economy kinda sucked these past few years because of stuff Trump left in place. I can tell you have little to no understanding of how the economy works. I think I see the issue. You believe the conspiracies that the Right loves to spew. And you think I listen to the stuff the Left spews. About bathrooms no matter what laws are in place. What really stops a man who dressing like a woman from using a woman’s rest room? I totally agree on that point I think most Americans want public restrooms used by people of the same sex only. But really how can anyone enforce that??? Police standing at every bathroom door? That’s literally the least important reason to vote for someone. Most states have men/women single person both gender bathrooms. This isn’t as prevalent as they told you.. Hate to break it to you. This country is the best on earth and was founded by The True Natives Americans (non whites) & built by black enslaved people and immigrants and that’s why America’s great! They chose to alienate every group from non Christians to undocumented Americans, to black people. Truly dividing everyone while also telling everyone he will be there champion. I hope you are a millionaire cause if not. These four years are gonna suck. Good luck we elected xenophobic homophobic orange celebrity with no actual government experience and was caught saying he wants the same type of generals that hitler had. Also said people eating cats and dogs when that wasn’t happening here.  ????"
2,I would love to revisit this comment in 4 years!

Gensler is a person who didnot even know about the 2FA application and his Twitter account was hacked 6 months ago. And now #Kamala wants to assign him as the SEC manager!! 2. Who are in the campaigne of #Kamala? #Joe_Biden, who cause the debt of America reached to new all-time-highs, and also he has the honor of making lots of wars in different countries arounf the world. A person who called more than half of the population of USA as garbage!! Suppose if a person from such a party is again accepted what will they name the people then? 3. She did not has any plan to reduce the debt of America and for the progression of economic conditions of America.

You are a puppet of your boss or your employer because you look to him to provide you with health care You look for him to tell you when and when not to go home and what to do in your home.
